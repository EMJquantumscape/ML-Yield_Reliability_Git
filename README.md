Hello!

This repository queries multilayer builds and relavent screening/reliability data. The main script is "ML_Yield&Reliability_Datahub.ipynb" and calls on sister function "genealogy_v2". To use this script, simply update the "search" variable with the builds you want to query and then run the script! This script takes about 0.5-5 minutes to run.
