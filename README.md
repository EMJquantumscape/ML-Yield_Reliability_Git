Hello!

This repository queries multilayer builds and relavent screening/reliability data. Their are two main codes a) "ML_Yield&Reliability_WithGroundTruthTiering.py" and b) "ML_Yield&Reliability.py". Both perform the same task but 
a) overwrites cathode misalignment and edge wetting metrics with manual review while b) does not update these metrics with manual review. To use these scripts, simply update the "search" variable with the builds you want to query and then run the script! 
This script takes about 0.5-1 minute per build.
